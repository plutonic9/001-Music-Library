		<p>First project.  Had just watched Code School "Front End Foundations" and wanted to try out the various lessons on my own small web pages.  Fixed width.  Designed with 1920 (hd) browser window in mind</p>
		
		<br>
		<p>Good Stuff:</p>
		<ol>Graying out the selected page from the menu.</ol>
		<ol>Overall reasonable seperation between content and style</ol>

		<br>
		<p>Bad Stuff:</p>
		<ol>Why does the screen/text shift when switching pages? (ie. slight left/right shift when moving between HOME and Brass Band, etc)</ol>
		<ol>CSS is a mess.... don't know selectors</ol>
		<ol>Cannot figure out on album pages how to -vertical center- the album text next to the images</ol>
		<ol>Everything is fixed width - ie. banner is 1920 (HD width), photos and text do no resize nicely when adjusting window size, etc</ol>
		<ol>Boring.  But a static page it is</ol>
	</ul>
